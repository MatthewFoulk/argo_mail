# Automate the Boring Stuff
This simple project will automate my weekly task of downloading the new Argo users, cleaning them, and importing them to Argo's Mailchimp audience. To do this I will make use of Mailchimp's API and the Google Drive API. This is intended to be a simple, quick and dirty project not an eloquent time-suck.
